## Components:


<details>
<summary> Video Metadata Extractor </summary>

1. VideoMetadataExtractor leverages PykTok library to extract TikTok Video metadata.

</details>

<details>
<summary> Comments Extractor </summary>

1. A chrome extension to extract comments from a TikTok Video.
2. The chrome extension will send network requests to log the comments to a HTTP Request Logger running locally.
3. Make sure to run the logger running locally prior to activating the extension.
4. Load the directory of the chrome extension as an unpacked extension to your chrome to try out the extension. **Do not** publish it to marketplace.

</details>

<details>
<summary>Logger</summary>

1. This is a HTTP Request Logger to log pixels sent by the chrome extension to local file system.
2. The output will be stored in extracted_data directory as a data_{id}.txt file where id = 0, 1, 2, 3, etc. such that each file will be approximately 2MB in size.
3. The implementation clears a set every 10<sup>5</sup> local log records, so there should be very few duplicates if any.
4. Run the logger using `node server.js`
5. The logger is now running on port 9000.

## Usecases and Commands

<details>
<summary> Fetch all URLs associated with a keyword in Search/Tag Pages of TikTok. </summary>


This component is a chrome extension to extract TikTok Video Links from the TikTok Tag page (Ex: https://www.tiktok.com/tag/datascience?lang=en) given a list of keywords.

The **KeywordURLExtractor chrome extension**  sends network requests from the page for each URL. These network requests can be logged to a local file by using the Logger Component.

`{"u": "<Tiktok Video URL>", "k": "<Keyword>", "t": "Search"}` for a search page and `{"u": "<Tiktok Video URL>", "k": "<Keyword>", "t": "Tag"}` for a tag page.


To use the chrome extension, update `line 42` where the variable keywords is defined as `var keywords = ` with the list of keywords for which URLs are to be extracted.


## How to toggle between Search page and Tag Page for URL extraction?
1. In the KeywordURLExtractor chrome extension, in background.js navigate to the bottom of the script
2. **Enabling Search Page:** Invoke call to `searchPageExample()` function. If you do not want to scrape tag pages comment the line `tagPageExample();`
   - Add keywords to the list marked by `var keywords = ` in `searchPageExample` function to scrape the search pages related to these keywords.
3. **Enabling Tag Page:** Code to enable tag page is active by default.
   - Add keywords to the list marked by `var keywords = ` in `tagPageExample` function to scrape the tag pages related to these keywords.


### Activate Chrome Extension.
1. Clear the `extracted_data` directory to prevent outputs from being appended to existing `data_*` files.
2. Run `node server.js` before activating the extension. 
3. Now activate the extension to get all the URLs once the server is running locally.

<details>
<summary> Video Metadata Extraction.</summary>

### Generate Unique List of URLs to crawl.
**Steps:**

1. Chrome Extension generates a log file where every line is a JSON of the form:
`{"u": "<TikTok Video URL>", "k": "<Keyword>", "t": "Search"}`
2. Run `python3 UniqueURLExtractor.py <CHROME_EXTENSION_OUTPUT_PATH> <OUTPUT_PATH>` 
   1. `<CHROME_EXTENSION_OUTPUT_PATH>` is the path to the output file generated by the locally running NodeJS Logger. (Note: If the Logger generated multiple "data_" files, make sure to concatenate them to a single file by command `cat data_*.txt > urls.txt`).
   2. `<OUTPUT_PATH>` is the path to the output file generated by UniqueURLExtractor python script.
3. Run `python3 GenerateUrlKeywordsMap.py <CHROME_EXTENSION_OUTPUT_PATH> <OUTPUT_PATH>`
   1. `<CHROME_EXTENSION_OUTPUT_PATH>` is the path to the output file generated by the locally running NodeJS Logger. (Note: If the Logger generated multiple "data_" files, make sure to concatenate them to a single file by command `cat data_*.txt > urls.txt`).
   2. `<OUTPUT_PATH>` is the path to the output file generated by UniqueURLExtractor python script.

### Video Metadata Extraction.
**Steps:**

4. Run the VideoMetadataExtractor component with command `python3 TikTokScraper.py <STEP2_RESULT> <OUTPUT_PATH>` where,
	1. `<STEP2_RESULT>` is the output file generated by step 2
	2. `<OUTPUT_PATH>` is the output file where the extracted video metadata will be stored. (We are extracting the video metadata to get an idea of how many comments are present for each URL, this will help us in allocating the right amount of time for scraping of each URL. For example, a video URL with only 10 comments will need far lesser time than a video URL with 1000 comments.)

<details>
<summary>Comments Extraction.</summary>

**Pre-requisite**: Run **Video Metadata Extraction** section above. This will help in estimating the amount of time to be allocated for crawling each URL while extracting comments.

**Steps:**

5. Run `python3 CommentCountPerURLExtractor.py <STEP_4_RESULT> <CSV_OUTPUT_PATH> <JSON_OUTPUT_PATH>`
	1. `<STEP_4_RESULT>` is the output generated by Step 4 in **Video Metadata Extraction** section above.
	2. `<CSV_OUTPUT_PATH>` is the output generated by CommentCountPerURLExtractor in CSV Format. Can be used in Excel to build pivot tables to visualize comment count distributions.
	3. `<JSON_OUTPUT_PATH>` is the output generated by CommentCountPerURLExtractor in JSON Format.
6. Run `python3 GenerateIdForUrls.py <STEP_5_JSON_RESULT> <OUTPUT_PATH>`
	1. `<STEP_5_JSON_RESULT>` is the JSON output generated by Step 5 CommentCountPerURLExtractor
	2. `<OUTPUT_PATH>` is the output generated by GenerateIdForUrls python script.
7. Place the output JSON from Step 6 in `background.js` of the CommentsExtractor Chrome Extension by replacing `var raw_data` with this JSON.
8. Activate the Logger locally to record the network requests that will be sent by the chrome extension. (Make sure to delete the local data_* files before enabling the chrome extension). Enable the chrome extension on `chrome://extensions` and the scraping should begin.
9. Navigate to the directory within the Logger where the records are logged. Concatenate the comments files into a single file with command `cat data_*.txt > comments.txt`.
10. Run `python3 CommentsPostProcess.py <STEP_6_RESULT> <STEP_9_RESULT> <COMMENTS_JSON_OUTPUT> <MISSING_URLS_OUTPUT>`
	1. `<STEP_6_RESULT>` is the JSON Output file created by Step 6 containing the URL to Id Map.
	2. `<STEP_9_RESULT>` is the comments file created by concatenating the data_* files.
	3. `<COMMENTS_JSON_OUTPUT>` is the output file containing a JSON where key is the URL and value is the list of comments associated with the URL.
	4. `<MISSING_URLS_OUTPUT>` - Missing URLs are URLs that were not present in the original list of URLs but were encountered during the crawling process. This could have occurred due to redirects from one of the original URLs in the list. `<MISSING_URLS_OUTPUT>` is an output text file where the missing URLs output will be stored.
11. If you would like to remove the Missing URLs from the COMMENTS_JSON_OUTPUT file generated by step 10, run `python3 cleanup.py <STEP2_RESULT> <COMMENTS_JSON_RESULT> <PATH_TO_OUTPUT>`
	1. `<STEP2_RESULT>` is the output from step 2 containing a unique list of URLs.
	2. `<COMMENTS_JSON_RESULT>` is the JSON containing the extracted comments from step 10
	3. `<PATH_TO_OUTPUT>` is the output generated by this program which will remove the missing URLs from the comments data in `<COMMENTS_JSON_RESULT>`.

**Side-Note:** Before step-8, if you wish to change the time-allocation strategy before initiating crawl - `getTimeForURL` function in background.js provides a time allocation strategy i.e.., number of seconds per URL for which it is scraped. You may choose to change this function implementation to your convenience.

The output from step 11 will contain the extracted comments in JSON format where key is the URL and value is the list of comments scraped for that URL by the chrome extension.

<details> 
	<summary> User TikTok Profile Metadata Extraction </summary>


**Steps**:
1. To extract User Profile Metadata, run `UserProfileExtractor.py` in VideoMetadataExtractor directory using the command `python3 UserProfileExtractor.py /path/to/input /path/to/output`.
2. Here, /path/to/input is the path to input file that contains a list of lines with each line the unique TikTok User Id
3. Here, /path/to/output is the path to output file generated by UserProfileExtractor script.
